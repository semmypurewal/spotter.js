  <h2>Spotter</h2>

<p>Spotter is an observable client-side Twitter search library written in JavaScript for
use in browser-based real-time Twitter applications.</p>

<p>It is based on the observer design pattern.  Clients register with a Spotter object
and are only notified when the Spotter recieves new search data.  The Spotter can be set to
search at a specified interval and notify all registered observers when new data is
returned, or it can search at intervals you specify in your code
(this may be useful for API throttling).</p>

<p>Spotter is easy to use and it's free (as in freedom)!  See the attached <a href="license.txt">LGPL</a> license
for more information.</p>

<p>See the <a href="examples">examples</a> for more detailed code, but -- seriously -- this
is all that's necessary:</p>

<pre><tt>//create your observing object
var observerObject = new Object();

//create your spotter
var spotter = Spotter.spotterFactory();

//set up your notify function
observerObject.notify = function(tweets)  {
  //if this is called, tweets will not be empty
  alert(tweets[0]['text']);
}

//register your observer
spotter.registerObserver(observerObject);

//look for new Justin Bieber results every 10 seconds
spotter.intervalSearch("justin bieber", 10); </tt></pre>

<p>That's all there is to it!</p>
