<p>Spotter is a client-side JavaScript library designed for browser-based real-time JSON applications and mashups.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it is an abstraction of push technologies like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>, which typically require server-side programming.  The goal of Spotter is to allow client-side developers to create applications that respond to 'pushes' so that when APIs support a push protocol (or cross-site long polling) the back-end can be rewritten to exploit this technology, without the application developer needing to change anything!</p>


<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Current support for Twitter (search and trends), Flickr (search), and Delicious (recents and tags)</li>
 <li>Completely client-side</li>
 <li>"Real-time" and flexible (although you should consult the Spotter documentation and the API documentation before changing the defaults)</li>
 <li>Extendible via a simple modular design</li>
 <li>OOP design allows you to easily integrate it into your OOP designs, but OOP is not necessary</li>
</ul>

<p>Spotter's interface is based on the Observer design pattern.  Observer objects (those that implement
the notify function) register with a Spotter object and are only notified when the Spotter
receives new data.  You can also use Spotter to send requests at specified intervals in your
code.</p>

<p>See the <a href="examples">examples</a> for more detailed code, but -- seriously -- this
is all that's necessary:</p>

<pre><tt>//create your observing object
var observerObject = new Object();

//create your spotter
var spotter = Spotter.spotterFactory("twitter.search",{searchString:"Justin Bieber"});

//set up your notify function
observerObject.notify = function(tweets)  {
  //if this is called, tweets will not be empty
  alert(tweets[0]['text']);
}

//register your observer
spotter.registerObserver(observerObject);

//look for new Justin Bieber results every 10 seconds
spotter.spot(10); </tt></pre>

<p>That's all there is to it!</p>

<p>Spotter modules are based on the Strategy design pattern.  To implement one, you build a
function that returns an object with a 'url' function and a 'process' function.  The url
function builds the URL associated with the feed (from options sent to the Spotter object via
the spotterFactory() method).  The process function determines if the feed actually has new
data and passes the processed data back to the spotter object who returns it to the client.</p>

<p>If you follow the convention of naming your module function spotter.modules.[service-name].[feed] then
spotter will auto-magically load it if you include it in your Javascript source file!</p>

</ul>
