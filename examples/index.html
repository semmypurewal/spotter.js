  <h2>Spotter Examples</h2>

  <p>Here's a couple of examples that use spotter.</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="bieber.html">The Bieber Example</a>: This example alerts the user at 10 second intervals when there's a new tweet about Justin Bieber (which, at the time of this writing, is at least every 10 seconds).  The entire program (with the exception of Spotter) is in the source document.</li>

   <li><a href="gadget.html">The Gadget Example</a>: This is example is slightly more interesting; it mimics the commonly seen Twitter gadget.  The current search term is 'oil spill.'  The JavaScript code can be found <a href="javascripts/application.js">here</a>.  This example uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jquery.com">JQuery</a> library for selectors, animation, and insertions into the DOM.</li>
  </ul>
