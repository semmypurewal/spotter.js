  <p>Here's a few examples that use spotter. Most of them use the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jquery.com">JQuery</a> library in addition to Spotter.</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="twitter/bieber.html">The Bieber Example</a>: This example alerts the user whenever there's a new tweet about Justin Bieber (at most once every 10 seconds).  The entire program (with the exception of Spotter) is in the source document.</li>

   <li><a href="twitter/trends.html">The Trends Example</a>: In this example, Twitter's trending topics are monitored and the page is updated as necessary.  The Spotter checks with the Twitter API every 30 seconds.</li>

   <li><a href="twitter/gadget.html">The Gadget Example</a>: This is example is slightly more interesting; it mimics the ubiquitous Twitter gadget.  The current search term is 'oil spill.'  The JavaScript code can be found <a href="javascripts/application.js">here</a>.</li>

   <li><a href="delicious">The Delicious Example</a>: This is example kinda sucks.  It uses the currently buggy delicious module to print out some recent things people have bokmarked.  In reality it's a copy/hack of the previous gadget app which is much cooler.  The JavaScript code be found <a href="delicious/javascripts/application.js">here</a>.</li>

   <li><a href="flickr">The Slideshow Example</a>: This example uses the Flickr API to produce a slideshow from a given search term.  Spotter does not act as a daemon in this example.  The entire program is in the html document.</li>

  </ul>
