  <p>Here's a few examples that use spotter.</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="bieber.html">The Bieber Example</a>: This example alerts the user at 10 second intervals when there's a new tweet about Justin Bieber (which, at the time of this writing, is at least every 10 seconds).  The entire program (with the exception of Spotter) is in the source document.</li>

   <li><a href="trends.html">The Trends Example</a>: In this example, the trending topics are added and then whenever they change the page is updated.  The Spotter checks with the Twitter API every 30 seconds.  This example uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jquery.com">JQuery</a> library for selectors, animations and insertions into the DOM.</li>

   <li><a href="gadget.html">The Gadget Example</a>: This is example is slightly more interesting; it mimics the ubiquitous Twitter gadget.  The current search term is 'oil spill.'  The JavaScript code can be found <a href="javascripts/application.js">here</a>.  This example also uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jquery.com">JQuery</a> library.</li>
  </ul>
