Spotter is an observable client-side Twitter search library written in JavaScript for
use in browser-based real-time Twitter application.

It is based on the observer design pattern.  Clients register with a Spotter object
and are only notified when the Spotter recieves new search data.  Spotter can be set to
search at a specified interval and notify all registered observers when new data is
returned, or it can search at intervals you specify in your code
(this may be useful for API throttling).

Spotter is easy to use and it's free (as in freedom)!  See the attached LGPL license
for more information.

**********
var observerObject = new Object();

//set up your notify function
observerObject.notify = function(tweets)  {
  //if this is called, tweets will not be empty
  alert(tweets[0]['text']);
}

//create your spotter
spotter = Spotter.spotterFactory();

//register your observer
spotter.registerObserver(observerObject);

//look for new Justin Beiber results every 10 seconds
spotter.intervalSearch("justin beiber", 10);

That's all there is to it!
